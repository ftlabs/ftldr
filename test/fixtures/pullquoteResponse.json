Without the US, there is no deal any more</p></pull-quote-text><pull-quote-source>European official</pull-quote-source></pull-quote>\n<p>Steffen Seibert, Ms Merkel’s spokesman, said last week that Germany was “concerned about Iran’s ballistic missile programme and about Iran’s regional activities because those, too, touch on European security interests”. </p>\n<p>European diplomats say they are focused on winning Mr Trump over, rather than making contingency plans for how to work around the potential reimposition of US sanctions that have been lifted in exchange for Iran restricting its nuclear activities. The deal was also signed by China and Russia and endorsed by the UN Security Council. </p>\n<p>“There is no plan B,” said one European official, pointing to the difficulty in shielding any European companies operating in Iran from the reach of restored US sanctions. “Without the US, there is no deal any more.” </p>\n<p>Mr Macron's three-day trip is the first state visit of the Trump administration and reflects the rapport between the two men. Ms Merkel is scheduled to visit on Friday for a working meeting at the White House.</p>\n<p>A senior US administration official said Iran would be a “major” topic of conversation when Mr Macron arrives on Monday, although Mr Trump still planned to reserve his final decision on the deal until mid-May. European countries had been “working hard on trying to address some of our most important or prominent concerns \", the official said, although the work was “not quite done yet”.</p>\n<p>The US is still looking for tougher measures on Iran’s ballistic missile programme and regional role, as well as an extension of so-called sunset clauses under which restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear activities start to fall way from 2025. “This is where we’re hoping for real contributions, and we’ll see if we get across the finish line right there,” the US official said.</p>\n<p>The sunset clauses have become symbolic of European doubts over whether even their best efforts will satisfy Mr Trump and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/John_Bolton\">John Bolton</a>, his new national security adviser and a long-time critic of the Iran deal. European diplomats argue privately that a decision by western powers to extend the clauses unilaterally would scupper the deal.</p>\n<p>EU efforts to impose sanctions on Iranian individuals and institutions over Tehran’s support for the Assad regime in Syria have also stalled, denying Mr Macron and Ms Merkel a first tangible outcome to show Mr Trump. A minority of the bloc’s states fear the countermeasures would not persuade the US president — but could strengthen hardliners in Tehran by allowing them to argue that Europe is trying to reimpose sanctions by the back door. </p>\n<p>“If the ambition is to keep the JCPOA alive, we should avoid creating a new list of sanctions,” said one EU diplomat critical of the proposed countermeasures. </p>\n<p>Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, has added to the pressure on the European countries by warning them against agreeing a formal side-agreement to the nuclear deal with Mr Trump. “We don’t condone it and we don’t believe it’s useful or fruitful or conducive to a better implementation of the JCPOA — and they know that to be our position,” he said at the weekend. </p>\n<p>Mr Zarif said it was “highly unlikely” that Iran would remain in the nuclear deal if the US dropped out. </p>\n<p>“Frankly, at this point the Europeans may have a harder time convincing Iran to stay in the deal than the US,” said Barbara Slavin, Iran expert at the Atlantic Council who met with Mr Zarif at the weekend. “This deal was really all about bringing Iran and Europe back together and Iran has not seen the benefits it expected from Europe.”</p>\n<p><em>Additional reporting by Tobias Buck in Berlin </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Twitter: @mikepeeljourno</em>\n</p>\n</body>","title":"European powers seek to sway Trump on Iran nuclear deal","standfirst":"Macron and Merkel will urge US president to stand by the accord","byline":"Michael Peel in Brussels and Katrina Manson in Washington","firstPublishedDate":"2018-04-23T04:00:26.000Z","publishedDate":"2018-04-23T04:00:26.000Z","requestUrl":"http://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/769e57ae-463c-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"mainImage":{"description":"Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, right, speaks while Emmanuel Macron, France's president, listens during a joint press conference in Berlin, Germany, on Monday, May 15, 2017.
